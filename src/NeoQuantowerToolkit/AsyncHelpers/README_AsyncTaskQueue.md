# Neo.Quantower.Toolkit.AsyncTaskQueue

`AsyncTaskQueue` is a prioritized, asynchronous task execution queue designed for background processing within indicators, strategies, or any multithreaded Quantower context.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Prioritized task queue: High, Normal, Low
- Async/await support with built-in cancellation
- Retry mechanism with configurable attempt count
- Timeout for each task execution
- Events for success/failure notifications
- Safe and thread-aware background execution

## üß± Core Concepts

- `Enqueue(Func<CancellationToken, Task>, TaskPriority)` ‚Äî add a task to the queue with a specified priority.
- `MaxRetryAttempts` ‚Äî retries tasks that fail or timeout, up to this number.
- `TaskTimeout` ‚Äî maximum allowed execution time per task.
- `OnTaskCompleted` ‚Äî event triggered when a task completes successfully.
- `OnTaskFailed` ‚Äî event triggered when a task fails or is cancelled.

## üöÄ Example usage

```csharp
var queue = new AsyncTaskQueue
{
    MaxRetryAttempts = 2,
    TaskTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)
};

queue.OnTaskCompleted += task => Console.WriteLine("Task completed.");
queue.OnTaskFailed += ex => Console.WriteLine($"Task failed: {ex.Message}");

queue.Enqueue(async ct =>
{
    await Task.Delay(500, ct);
    Console.WriteLine("Executed.");
});
```

## üîÅ Lifecycle

- Runs a background task loop on construction.
- Clean shutdown by calling `Dispose()` to cancel and flush the queue.

## üì¶ Ideal for

- Parallel/async operations from indicators without blocking update threads
- Deferred or buffered execution
- Fault-tolerant retryable background jobs
